# Capstone-Project-Linear-Regression
Linear Regression project to predict the Bike Sharing demand at a given hour of the day.
The rental bike sharing demand deals with the problem of demand and
supply of the rental bike at any given hour of the day depending on some
circumstances and environmental factors.
Since the Rental bikes provide a state
of comfort to the customer therefore it
is the duty of the supplier to maintain
the correct count of bikes at the
correct hour of the day.
